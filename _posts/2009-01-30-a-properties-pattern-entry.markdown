Interesting, a bit long entry about using properties (key/value)  pattern for modeling programs. As writer says, I'm seeing properties  everywhere ;-).

As a side note, I should check XML databases, and learn (and practice)  more about XPath, XQuery, JQuery, ... It's a pity we've just one lifetime :-(
