I know this is endless and useless, but I'm trying to do my best in handling my incoming digital flow (ideas from twitter, blogs and other pages in internet).

Eons ago, I started by sending me an email with any digital idea I have to review, and putting some time aside to empty my inbox and process all those ideas.

Also, I've been using the awesome Instapaper ([http://www.instapaper.com](http://www.instapaper.com)) to store and read when it was possible all interesting ideas that came from blogs and other sources. For a moment, it seemed under control (Wrong!).

And when Twitter appeared, I've started to mark as favorite those ideas that needed some spare time to read along and reflect on them.

The problem is spare time is a very scarce resource, so finding that time was being problematic.

So, I've been writing an java application to extract daily favorites in Twitter and send me as a summary email (Yes, I still have to read that email, but at least I don't have to fight against ugly Twitter web interface).

After using it for a while, I've evolved it a bit, to get also a summary email with self-sent emails and some ideas I select to work with after reading them through Instapaper.

I'm releasing it, maybe someone can use it too, or suggest other options.
