We've seen the testing capabilities of testNG, not only unit testing but also integration testing. The chapter 6 set the focus on extending the framework itself, using it in ways that the author didn't foresight or didn't consider to support.

It's surprised me the possibility of using BeanShell to control programatically which tests are been executed, and also the possibilities of creating an testng.xml on the fly, and create new annotations to control the way tests are executed. The part of listeners and reporters has been a bit long and verbose.

The last chapter is used by the authors to express their opinions about several facts on testing, such as TDD, debuggers or loggers. Interesting opinions, not all shared, but thought-provoking.

So, this ends the reading and comments about this book. I expected a bit more explanation of testNG itself, but it's been an interesting book, with some new ideas about testing, mainly integration testing.
