Finished reading chapter 4 of [Next Generation Java Testing](http://www.amazon.com/Next-Generation-Java-Testing-Advanced/dp/0321503104/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1233853296&sr=8-1)

Interesting chapter (A bit long, although shorter than the 130 pages of chapter 2 :-O ), focused in integration testing (oriented to J2EE  container testing). It relates several tools (Spring, ActiveMQ, ...) and options for testing, such in-container testing, mocking/stub  testing. The main idea I get is to stop before start testing and ask yourself: what do you want to test?. As we were told in JUnit Recipes,  you shouldn't test the infrastructure of your application, but just your application. 

Next chapter is titled Integration, with issues as different as DBUnit, Guice or Swing testing !!??. We'll see.
