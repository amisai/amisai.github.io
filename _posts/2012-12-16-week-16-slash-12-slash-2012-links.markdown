It's been an intense week, before freezing deployments period at $JOB, so not so many links. May I choose two links today? 

First has to do with all this electronics and domotic fever I'm suffering lately, but if a "common" guy (I don't know him/her, so maybe I'm talking too fast here) can make his smartphone do [this](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2731), mmm, yeah, we're already in the future, we should be thinking in after-future.

The second one has to do with us, who we are, where we live. When awful (bad written, new age stuff) "Ten revelations" book tries to explain human history mentions this century (and two previous) scientifics as explorers, sent by humanity to understand Nature, Universe and Everything else. In this way, I think astronauts are this age explorers, human beings sent to explore outer limits. But then they looked back, and they saw Earth, and they saw us in different eyes.
